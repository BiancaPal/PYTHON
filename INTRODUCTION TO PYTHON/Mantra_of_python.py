# Anything following a hash mark in your code is ignored by the Python interpreter

# Say hello to everyone
print("Hello everyone!")

# The main reason to write comments is to explain what code is supposed to do and how you are making it work. After some time apart, you can always study your code for a while and figure out how segments were supposed to work.
# In order to become a better programmer or collaborate with other programmers, you should write meaningful comments. Writing clear, concise comments in yout code is one of the most beneficial habits you can form as a new programmer.
# When you're determining whether to write a comment, ask yourself is you had to consider several approaches before coming up with a reasonable way to make something work, if so write a comment about your solution.

#The Zen of Python
# Beatiful is better than ugly
# Explicit is better than implicit
# Simple is better than complex
# Complex is better than complicated
# Flat is better than nested
# Sparse is better than dense
# Readability counts
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
# Although practicality beats purity
# Errors should never pass silently
# Unless explicity silenced
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than ever.
# Although neves is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
# If the implementation is east to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
