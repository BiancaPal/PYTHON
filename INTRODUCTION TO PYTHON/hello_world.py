# Naming and using variables
# -Variables names can contain only letters, numbers and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore but not with a number
# -Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names
# -Avoid using Python keywords and functions names as variable names, that is not to use words that Python has reserved for a particular programmatic purpose, such as the word print.
# -Variable names should be short but descriptive.
# -Be careful when using, "l" or "O", they can be confused with 1 and 0.

# -The Python variables you're using at this point shoul be lowercase.
